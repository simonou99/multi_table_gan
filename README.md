# Multi-Table GAN

This repository contains the implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) methodology for generating synthetic data from multiple relational tables while preserving both the statistical properties within each individual table and the relationships between them. Users can specify different generator models for each table, allowing for specialized generators tailored to the characteristics of each table.

## Features
- Generate synthetic data from multiple relational tables
- Preserve relationships between tables
- Preserve statistical properties within each individual table
- Customizable generator models for each table
- Extensible architecture for adding more advanced models and loss functions
