# Multi-Table GAN

This repository contains the implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) methodology for generating synthetic data from multiple relational tables while preserving both the statistical properties within each individual table and the relationships between them. Users can specify different generator models for each table, allowing for specialized generators tailored to the characteristics of each table.
